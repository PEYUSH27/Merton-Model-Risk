# Merton-Model-Risk
Merton Model Implementation in Python

This notebook implements the Merton Model, a structural model for credit risk that treats equity as a call option on a firmâ€™s assets. Using firm value, debt, volatility, and risk-free rate, it calculates:
1-Distance to Default (DD)
2-Probability of Default (PD)
3-Equity value as an option
4-Credit spread

ðŸ”Ž Analysis Results

From the implementation:

1-The Distance to Default was found to be positive, indicating the firmâ€™s asset value is sufficiently above its debt obligation.
2-The Probability of Default was low, suggesting a relatively safe credit profile.
3-The Equity Value closely aligned with option-based valuation, validating the structural approach.
4-The Credit Spread reflected the marketâ€™s compensation for default risk, consistent with theoretical expectations.
5-This demonstrates how the Merton Model can be applied for credit risk evaluation and default probability estimation.
